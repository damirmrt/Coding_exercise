'''
You are given a 
    An integer, or
    A list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.
The depth of an integer is defined by how deeply it is nested inside lists.
Your task is to return the sum of all integers in the list, weighted by their depth.

ðŸ”¹ Example 2:
Input: [ [1,1], 2, [1,1] ]
Breakdown:
    First [1,1] is at depth 2 â†’ each 1 * 2 = 2, total = 4
    2 is at depth 1 â†’ 2 * 1 = 2
    Second [1,1] is at depth 2 â†’ each 1 * 2 = 2, total = 4
Output: 4 + 2 + 4 = 10
